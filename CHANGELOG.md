# v0.1.0

## Features
- Aggregate Behaviour
- Aggregate Server and supervisior
- Aggregate Registry and distributed Tracker based on swarm
- Endpoint routing for commands. Endpoint must be started in  
  application supervision three, e.g. `{MyApp.Endpoint, []}`
- Autogenerated facade per aggregate during compile time. If router module 
  namespace is `MyApp.Router`, facade is compiled in `MyApp.Facade` module 
  where submodules will be named by aggregate name, e.g. 
  `MyApp.Aggregates.UserAggregate`, facade for this aggregate is
  generated as `MyApp.Facade.User`
